    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "#### Another key to making this model work is a kernel-size-7 Gaussian smoothing step in order to remove the significant pixel clusters that represent objects or dirty marks on the road. Together with a high low_threshold in Canny detection, this method removes the long horizontal white lines in the white lanes video.\n",

    "#### In the forum, in answer to a student's problem with jittery lines, another suggested using the previous frame's slope when the current frame's is obviously incorrect. Regardless of the challenge in determing the outlier, introducing a global variable across frames is an extra layer of brittleness and bad form. Therefore I deliberately attempted to preserve some resemblance of robustness by limiting the scope of my algorithm to the current frame.\n",

    "#### It remains a challenge to programmatically determine these parameters to reduece the extreme brittleness of a typical solution for this project. One method is an iterative process to remove outliers in the extrapolation step. However, that extra loop would be expensive for a video-processing algorithm, especially one requiring real-time output without lags. Another solution is finding a better fitting algorithm without learning. I have been exploring this route but without graduate-level statistics, I am quite helpless."
